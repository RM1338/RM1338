Aspiring Software Engineer | B.Tech CSE Student building scalable web applications and solving real-world problems through code. Currently in my first year at Karunya Institute of Technology and Sciences, I'm focused on developing strong foundations in software engineering principles, data structures, and full-stack development ​.

Engineering Philosophy

I believe great software engineering combines clean architecture, efficient algorithms, and user-centric design. My approach centers on writing maintainable code, understanding system design, and continuously learning industry best practices. Whether it's implementing JWT authentication, designing RESTful APIs, or optimizing database queries, I focus on building solutions that scale.​​

Technical Projects

Resume Builder Pro: Architected a full-stack MERN application with secure authentication, RESTful API design, and MongoDB Atlas integration. Implemented real-time analytics tracking and cloud-based persistence with comprehensive CRUD operations.​

NutriQuest & Edunova: Developed gamification platforms addressing social challenges—promoting healthy eating habits and rural education accessibility through interactive web experiences.​

Each project strengthens my understanding of software development lifecycle, from requirements gathering to deployment.​

Problem-Solving Track Record

Qualified for Round 2 of Digital Campus 2.0 Hack Sprint (Google Cloud x GeeksforGeeks) and shortlisted by my university for Smart India Hackathon 2025. These competitive environments sharpened my ability to debug complex issues, optimize performance, and deliver under deadlines.​​
